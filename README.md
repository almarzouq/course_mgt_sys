# Process description
- Be sure to *fork* the project in your github repository
- Create new branch to work on from *dev* branch
- Push changes to *your* github repository fork
- Send pull request when you push an update, and choose the branch you worked on
- *ALWAYS* work on a new branch for every new feature

# sending a pull request
- After forking the original project, clone your forked project to your local machine
- *ALWAYS* start from branch dev, switch to it using `git checkout dev`
- Create a new branch from branch dev by running `git checkout -b newbranchname`
- After completing and testing your work, commit it
- finally, push your new branch to your forked project using `git push origin newbranchname`
- Got ot github, issue a pull request to the almarzouq/course_mgt_sys (branch dev)

# Working with the most recent copy of the dev branch
- *IMPORTANT* after forking the project, create a remote called upstream:
      git remote add upstream https://github.com/almarzouq/course_mgt_sys.git
- Before creating any branch, switch to branch dev, and run `git pull upstream dev`
  This will update the dev to match what is on the project dev repository so
  you can work on a fresh copy

# final project instructions
  1. Never work on dev or master.
  2. Never push to master.
  3. Never modify Models until you talk to the project manager.
  4. Never run Makemigrations if you need to talk to project manager.
